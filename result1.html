               Make time to unwind. Try to do some other activities you enjoy.
           </li>

           <li>
               Take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories, including those on social media. It's good to be informed but hearing about the traumatic event constantly can be upsetting. Consider limiting news to just a couple of times a day and disconnecting from phone, tv, and computer screens for a while.
           </li>

           <li>
               Avoid drugs and alcohol. These may seem to help, but they can create additional problems and increase the stress you are already feeling.
           </li> 
           <li>
               Recognize when you need more help. If problems continue or you are thinking about suicide, talk to a psychologist, social worker, or professional counselor.

    <ul>
        <li>Mindful meditation with an app. If you'd like a little nudge to find your zen, help is at hand-in the palm of your hand, to be precise, with a host of meditation apps that can work wonders for helping you de-stress.</li>

        <li>Maintain a gratitude journal. Consider this as the '100 days of happiness' experiment, but with better longevity. Before you go to bed at night, list down the positive events that happened to you during the day to gain better perspective the next time things go haywire.</li>

        <li>
            Write checklists. It may be easy to keep a running list in your head about all the things you need to do in a day, but with so many other matters fighting for attention in your headspace, you may just end up over-stressing yourself because of it.

        <ul>
            <li>Exercise increases your overall health and your sense of well-being, which puts more pep in your step every day. But exercise also has some direct stress-busting benefits.</li>
        
            <li>It pumps up your endorphins. Physical activity may help bump up the production of your brain's feel-good neurotransmitters, called endorphins.</li>  
        
            <li>It reduces negative effects of stress. Exercise can provide stress relief for your body while imitating effects of stress, such as the flight or fight response, and helping your body and its systems practice working together through those effects.</li>

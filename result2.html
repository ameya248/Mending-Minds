        Many of us struggle with stress-at work and in our personal life. Like any problem, stress requires a strategic approach to conquer, or at least manage. Stress is real, but we always have a choice-we can let it consume us or we learn to control it. You can't always control what goes on outside, but you can always control what goes on inside. We all have those things that even in the midst of stress and disarray, they energize us and give us renewed strength and purpose. So try to find those things and remember you are not alone.
